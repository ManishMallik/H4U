# H4U

Do you want to keep track of your diet and get to a certain weight? Do you want to know what your mental health is like? Do you want statistics of your health each day? H4U can help you do all of this. It will record the food you have, your exercises and workouts, and your journal entries containing how you feel each day and provide graphs and feedback for your habits. The graphs and feedback will help determine whether your habits are Healthy For You or Horrible For You (H4U).
